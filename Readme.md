This repository contains different machine learning techniques applied on graphs.
The models are mainly built using SNAP and pytorch geometric (apart from other obvious libraries :P).

Most of the work is by going through the
stanford cs224w course and reading relevant research papers.

Currently the repo contains the following -
* **Belief Propagation (BP)** on a small graph.
* **Graph Neural Networks** - GCN, GAT, GraphSage.
* **Role Discovery** in Graphs using Refex-Rolx technique.

TODO -
* Learn how BP is implemented in practice. Implement and see results for a real dataset.
* Implement Community Detection algorithms.
